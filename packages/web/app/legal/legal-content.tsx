                  A climb on a standardised board is a list of hold positions on a fixed,
                  standardised layout (e.g. &quot;start on A5, use B12, C3, D18, finish on K11&quot;),
                  combined with a grade and wall angle. This is factual, functional
                  information &mdash; comparable to a chess position, a set of GPS coordinates,
                  or a phone number &mdash; not a creative work of authorship.

                  A standardised board with a finite number of holds (typically 200&ndash;500) produces
                  climb definitions that are inherently constrained, factual, and functional.

                  A database that comprehensively collects all user submissions without
                  editorial curation (as these platforms do) is analogous to an alphabetical
                  phone directory, which the Court found unprotectable in <em>Feist</em>.
