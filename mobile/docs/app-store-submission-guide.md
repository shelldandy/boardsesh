# App Store Submission Guide

Step-by-step instructions for submitting Boardsesh to the iOS App Store.

## Prerequisites

- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) - https://developer.apple.com/programs/
- Xcode 15 or later installed
- An iOS Distribution certificate in your Apple Developer account
- An App Store provisioning profile for `com.boardsesh.app`
- Team ID: `9L3HKPZBH3`
- Bundle ID: `com.boardsesh.app`

Make sure your signing certificate and provisioning profile are installed in Xcode before starting. You can check this in Xcode > Settings > Accounts > your Apple ID > Manage Certificates.

## 1. Generate Assets (App Icon, Splash Screen)

From the repo root:

```bash
cd mobile
bun run generate-assets
```

This generates all required icon sizes and splash screen assets from the source images in `mobile/resources/`. The output goes into `mobile/ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/`.

Verify the generated assets look correct before proceeding.

---

## 2. Take Screenshots

Automated approach using Playwright:

```bash
cd packages/web
bunx playwright test e2e/app-store-screenshots.spec.ts
```

Screenshots are saved to `mobile/screenshots/`.

### Required screenshot sizes

| Device | Resolution | Required? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 6.9" iPhone (iPhone 16 Pro Max) | 1320x2868 | Yes |
| 6.5" iPhone (iPhone 14 Plus) | 1284x2778 | Can reuse 6.9" screenshots |
| 12.9" iPad (iPad Pro) | 2048x2732 | No, but recommended |

### Manual alternative

If the Playwright tests are not set up or you need specific screenshots:

1. Open Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators
2. Create or select an iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator
3. Run the app in the simulator
4. Navigate to each key screen:
   - Board selection / home
   - Climb list with search results
   - Climb detail with hold overlay on board image
   - Queue panel with multiple climbs
   - Bluetooth connection / pairing screen
   - Party Mode session view
   - Logbook / profile stats
5. Press Cmd+S in the simulator to save a screenshot

### Screenshot tips

- Use the demo account (test@boardsesh.com / test) so there is real data in the logbook.
- Show a variety of boards (Kilter and Tension at minimum).
- Make sure the queue has 3-5 climbs to show the feature clearly.
- For the Bluetooth screenshot, show the scanning/pairing UI (it does not need a connected board).

## 3. Build & Archive

1. Open `mobile/ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. In the top toolbar, set the build target to **Any iOS Device (arm64)** (not a simulator).
3. Menu: **Product > Archive**.
4. Wait for the build and archive to complete. This can take a few minutes.
5. When done, the Xcode Organizer window opens automatically showing your new archive.

If the archive fails:
- Check that your signing certificate is valid and not expired.
- Check that the provisioning profile matches the bundle ID `com.boardsesh.app`.
- Check that Capacitor native dependencies are installed: `cd mobile/ios/App && pod install`.

## 4. Upload to App Store Connect

1. In the Xcode Organizer (**Window > Organizer**), select the archive you just created.
2. Click **Distribute App**.
3. Select **App Store Connect** as the distribution method.
4. Select **Upload** (not Export).
5. Leave the default options (bitcode, symbols, etc.) and click **Next**.
6. Select the signing profile **Boardsesh App Store Distribution** (should be auto-detected).
7. Click **Upload**.
8. Wait for the upload to complete. You will see a success message.

The build will appear in App Store Connect within 5-30 minutes after upload. Apple runs automated processing (including a basic compliance check) before it becomes available.

## 8. Common Rejection Reasons and How to Avoid Them

### 4.2 Minimum Functionality (web wrapper)

Apple rejects apps that are just websites wrapped in a WebView without meaningful native functionality. Our defense:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy board control is impossible in iOS Safari.** The Web Bluetooth API is not supported. This is the entire reason the native app exists.
- The review notes explain this clearly with a link to caniuse.com.
- Include a screenshot of the Bluetooth pairing flow in the screenshots.
- If questioned, respond with: "The app uses CoreBluetooth via Capacitor's BLE plugin to communicate with climbing board LED controllers. This functionality is not available in any iOS browser."

### 5.1.1(v) Account Deletion

Apple requires all apps with account creation to also support account deletion.

- Before submitting, verify that **Settings > Delete Account** works and fully removes the user's data.
- Test this with a throwaway account, not the demo account.

### 2.1 Performance (App Completeness)

- Test the app on a real device (not just simulator) before submitting.
- Make sure the app loads within a few seconds on a good network connection.
- If the Capacitor WebView takes too long to load, Apple may reject for performance. Consider adding a native splash screen that stays visible until the web content is ready.

### 2.5.1 Software Requirements

- Make sure the app does not crash on the latest iOS version.
- Test on the oldest iOS version you support (check `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in the Xcode project).

---

## 9. Post-Submission

- Apple reviews typically take **1 to 3 days**, sometimes faster.
- You will get an email if the app is approved or rejected.
- If approved with "Manually release" selected, go to App Store Connect and click "Release this version" when you are ready.

### If rejected

1. Read the rejection reason carefully. Apple usually cites a specific guideline number.
2. Fix the issue.
3. Upload a new build (increment the build number, not necessarily the version number).
4. Resubmit with a reply in the Resolution Center explaining what you changed.

### BLE-specific questions from review

Apple reviewers sometimes ask for more detail about Bluetooth usage. Be ready to explain:
- What BLE services and characteristics the app connects to (the board's LED controller service).
- That data only flows from the phone to the board (lighting commands), not the other way.
- That no personal data is transmitted over Bluetooth.

### After approval

- Monitor crash reports in App Store Connect > App Analytics.
- Update the `What's New` text for each new version.
- Subsequent updates go through the same build > upload > submit flow but are usually reviewed faster.
